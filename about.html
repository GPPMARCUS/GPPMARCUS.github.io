            <h1>About</h1>
            <p id="about">The Music Video Formula is a tool that provides the user with a set of prompts that can help inspire you in making a music video.
            It offers enough creative decisions to make a full fledged music video from just the prompts, but the often unusual combinations of prompts encourage you
            to interpret the scenes and extend onto the generated filmplan with your own ideas.
            <br><br>
            The Formula tells you to use 3 people in a scene, you decide who they will be.
            <br><br>
            The Formula wants you to apply the color red, you decide whether it will be in lighting or art direction.
            <br><br>
            The Formula writes a concept and you get to project your own preferences onto it.
            <br><br>
